5. Business Problem:
Organizations often struggle to gain a clear, consolidated view of their workforce data. Information about employee distribution, salary structures, and performance ratings is usually scattered across systems, making it difficult for HR and management to identify trends, ensure pay equity, monitor performance, and optimize resource allocation. This lack of visibility can lead to inefficiencies, disengagement, and missed opportunities for improving workforce productivity.

i. The goal of this dashboard is to provide a centralized, interactive view of employee data, enabling leadership and HR teams to:
ii. Track workforce distribution by department, location, and work mode.
iii. Monitor salary trends and performance ratings at both overall and departmental levels.
iv. Identify workforce imbalances, pay disparities, and performance gaps.
v. Support data-driven decisions that enhance employee engagement, efficiency, and organizational growth.
